- Embedding Arithmetic
    - Try embedding experiment using cosine similarity
    - Look for specialized dataset for performing embedding arithmetic and similar
        - Gensim, gensim.test.utils
        - https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/keyedvectors.html

- Embedding Arithmetic additional ideas
    - Try with output embedding instead of input embedding
        - Difficult with autoregressive models
        - Maybe LaMa does sentence embedding during pretraining
    - Understand how the embedding of a token and its relationships change throughout layers of a model
