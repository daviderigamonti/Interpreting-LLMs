# Nicolò 29/5/24

- Nicolò is working on mapping the activation circuit:
    - Check if there exists a summation algorithm inside layers
    - Generate arithmetic operation dataset
    - Trace FFNN/attention activations
    - Look at highest activations
    - Test with ablations

- Reiterate analysis of relevance geometric properties of embeddings for transformers
    - Interest is not enough to justify the work, there need to be clear research interests
    - Prioritize literature
    - Check linearity of transformer transformations
    - Possible justification of rogue dimensions
